			The code we are looking for is 200. A 200 code means that it is okay to scrape the desired web page. The status code is similar to the 404 error that you receive when you enter a URL into the address bar that does not exist, which means page not found.
			Typically, errors starting with 4 means there was an error on your side. <br /> Errors starting with 5 typically means there was an error on the servers and thereâ€™s nothing you can do.
